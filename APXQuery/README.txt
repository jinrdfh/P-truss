This project is the query algorithm about "(ùúñ, Œîùëü )-APX", written in C++.
Here is the structure.
/..................
	README.txt
	code/..........
		Makefile
		getGraph.cpp
		.
		.
		.
		tool/........
			.
			.

All codes about the algorithm is in "/code/".
Some codes in "/code/tool/" are about debug and list operation.
The main function is in "/code/getGraph.cpp".

######compile
First put the whole folder into a Linux server (I use CentOS 6.10 (64-bit)).
Then enter the "/code/" folder.
Finally enter the command "make".

Several files will be generated.
The file "APXQuery.out" generated is the program file.
The version of g++ is "gcc version 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-23) (GCC)".

######run
Here is the command:
./APXQuery.out ${resultPath} ${dataFile} ${kSpace} ${miniP} ${dataLabel} ${queryFile} ${indexPath}

For example, if we enter the follow command:
./APXQuery.out ./result ./datasets/Fruit-Fly.txt 1 0.1 APX-Fruit-Fly ./query.txt ./index/APX

the program will generate a series of files under the folder "./result/".

The first parameter "${resultPath}" is the path where the result will be saved.
The second parameter "${dataFile}" is the location and the file name of the dataset.
The third parameter "${kSpace}" is the interval of k, which is the function that we are studying and is not mentioned in the paper. This can be ignored by just set it as "1".
The forth parameter "${miniP}" is the pruning probability \epsilon.
The fifth parameter "${dataLabel}" is the name of dataset, which is used to identify the index under the folder "./index/".
The sixth parameter "${queryFile}" is the location and the file name of the query.
Here we put queries in the file for querying in batch.
The seventh parameter "${indexPath}" is the path where the index locates.

######query file format
k,\gamma
.
.
.
where (k,\gamma)-truss is required.
For example, 
.
.
.
4,0.754478
3,0.661324
5,0.098194
.
.
.
k should not be larger than k_{\max}.

######dataset format
u,v,p
.
.
.

where "u" and "v" are nodes id and p is the probability.
For example, 
.
.
.
31,3709,0.191
32,2386,0.226
33,1298,0.196
