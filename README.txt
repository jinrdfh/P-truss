There are 5 projects in this folder:
1. "CPT-Basic" is the program about the algorithm "CPT-Basic": The basic (𝑘,𝛾)-truss indexing scheme for exact CPT-index construction using Algorithm 2. The CPT-indexbased (𝑘,𝛾)-truss retrieval provides optimal answers;
2. "CPT-Fast" is the program about the algorithm "CPT-Fast": An improved (𝑘,𝛾)-truss indexing scheme for exact CPT-index construction using Algorithm 3, which can partition the graph to speed up. CPT-Fast uses the same (𝑘,𝛾)-truss
retrieval method as CPT-Basic;
3. "APX" is the program about the algorithm "(𝜖, Δ𝑟 )-APX": An (𝜖, Δ𝑟 )-approximate indexing scheme in Section 7, trades off the efficiency of index construction and query processing and achieves exact query answers;
4. "CPTQuery" is the query program corresponding to algorithms "CPT-Basic" and "CPT-Fast";
5. "APXQuery" is the query program corresponding to algorithm "(𝜖, Δ𝑟 )-APX";

The five executable files are also attached in this folder.
You can use the command "chmod +x *.out" to give them executable rights.

Besides, experiments results are in "experiments-results".
Some datasets used in experiments are in "datasets".
